Prime Game Module.

This module defines a game played between two players, 'Maria' and 'Ben',
over multiple rounds. In each round, players consider all prime numbers up to
a given integer `n`. The player who can pick the last prime wins that round.

The winner of the game is determined by counting the number of rounds each
player wins. If the number of prime numbers up to `n` is odd, Maria wins
the round if the count is even, Ben wins.

Functions:
    - isWinner(x, nums): Determines the overall winner of the game.
    - count_primes(n): Counts the number of prime numbers up to a given number.
    - is_prime(num): Checks whether a given number is prime.

Usage:
    >>> isWinner(3, [4, 5, 6])
    'Maria'

def isWinner(x, nums):
    """
    Determines the overall winner of the prime number game.

    The game consists of `x` rounds. For each round, players consider all prime
    numbers up to a given integer `num` (from the `nums` list). The player who
    wins the majority of the rounds is declared the overall winner.

    Rules:
    - If the number of prime numbers up to `num` is odd, Maria wins the round.
    - If the number of prime numbers up to `num` is even, Ben wins the round.

    :param x: (int) Number of rounds to be played.
    :param nums: (list of int) List of integers, where each integer specifies
                 the upper limit for prime counting in a given round.
    :return: (str or None) Returns:
             - 'Maria' if Maria wins more rounds.
             - 'Ben' if Ben wins more rounds.
             - None if there is a tie.

    Example:
    >>> isWinner(3, [4, 5, 6])
    'Maria'

    Counts the total number of prime numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
